<h1>A report from the course web development</h1>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>
The answer regarding Git and GitHub is yes since we have used it
during the past two years in the university,
but it was good to review and read more about them,
plus there were some techniques about them that I wasn't aware of.
Markdown and GitHub pages, these two techniques are
completely new to me and so it's a great beginning to use or learn new tools.

Well, I have not done that before to create my own website or any,
but few years ago I have tried once but
at that time I had no knowledge regarding creating a new website,
so I stopped.

As my answer in the second question,
my experience and the knowledge I have regarding web development
are so little and it was when I tried to create my website from scratch,
at that time I tried to learn some tools and technologies
such as HTML and CSS and it was great stuff to learn
but it needed time to create the website that I needed so I stopped.

My "Today I Learned" for the section was almost everything
inside the section excluding some small thing and I was aware of,
but for example, the GitHub pages it was completely new to me,
and how to link files from on to another and from
inside a directory to another one
</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>The knowledge that I have about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is so little,
and so I have a little experience in HTML and CSS but nothing regarding JavaScript.
Every Website we open in our browser uses HTML,
it used to describe the structure of information on a web page.
While CSS plays the role of the page's appearance and
JavaScripts does the functionality or let's say that it programming its functionality. '
The browser in other word a client sends and the server plays an important
role to establish the connection over HTTP protocol, to establish the connection.
The client(Browser) sends requests for services for example,
and this request is known as an HTTP request, it goes to the server and the server
searches for the data, if it finds it,it sends a response to the client,
and the response called HTTP respond.
I have learned how to create my own website and write in it and change pictures and sizes. </p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>No, I had no knowledge regarding client-side JavaScript. I can't compare it to Java since
it's the only programming language that I know, and I can't see the difference yet except that
the structure of the code is different. For now I did the requarments for grade 3, and since everything is new to me,
it was hard to finish, and have it fixed.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>This is my first time working with node/npm and I had no experience in another
or equal programming tool, however it was a great tool to learn and do some small
exercises on them. Regarding the assignment, I had to do the steps or trainging before starting
the actual task because I don't think I would get it work without doing that, for now I finished
level three.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S05</h2>
<p>Well, in my opinion, it was like other programming languages. Comparing PHP
to another language is not easy for me since I don't know many languages, so comparing it to java is not ok from my point of view. First of all, I aim to do grade
3 but after solving grade 3, I found it interesting to continue to grade 3.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S06</h2>
<p>Well, I'm pretty confident that the first language I leared was Java,
since it's one of the largest languages plus it continue to be number one programming language.
My own choice would be c# I guess, this language is easy, or let's say that it's very similare to
Java from my point of view, as well as it has many features.
My comparison was between c# and Java, why c# and Java?, because I think C#
is really handful language while Java is because it's the most programming
language, I found that in worldwide they both are very equal.</p>

<h2>S07</h2>
<p>All I can say about .NET is a nice and easy technique to use. It supports
websites as well as desktop apps. Regarding the grade I aim for, it was 5,
but I had some difficulties with some tasks which lead me to end up with grade 4,
in any way it was a great opportunity to learn something new.

<p>Web performance matters are it affects the userâ€™s experience on certain websites, slow website response leads to user dissatisfaction with the service and avoid using it, whereas good and fast response leads to user satisfaction. Therefore, is it is importance to enhance the performance of the websites.
Web performance is measured by the time that is needed to completely load a website. It is
We have selected three websites that we and other students at HKR tend to use frequently, the websites are specified in the table below.
We ran performance check on the three websites, using PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse Audits and Devtools Network tab.
For more performance details Googlesheet.
<body>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>  </th>
    <th>student.ladok.se/student/#/aktuell</th>
    <th>hkr.instructure.com</th>
    <th>hkr.se</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Performance</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>97</td>
    <td>99</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</body>

<p>An overall analysis concludes common improvements such as:</p>
<p>-	Keep request count low and transfer sizes small</p>
<p>-	Values of id attributes should be unique</p>
<p>-	Stop using insecure javascript libraries</p>
<p>-	Add a passive flag to every event listener that Lighthouse identified.</p>
<p>-	Add a meta description element to the head of each of your pages.</p>
<p>-	Add accessible names to links</p>
<p>-	Optimizing image sizing</p>
<p>-	Ensure text remains visible during webfont load</p>
<p>-	Use HTTP2 instead of HTTP1.1</p>
<p>-	Remove unused CSS</p>

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>I have seen and fall in many issues, for example,
bad links or evil links that if a user does something in that site,
might lead to load bad scripts, and this is related to "Cross-Site Scripting XSS",
another attack that called SQL injection attack is when an attacker uses a web form
field or URL parameter to gain access to or manipulate a database.
Uploading files from users, by allowing users to upload files might risky without having
strong security since these files can or could contain scripts that can open the website completely.
Guidelines: such as enforce a strong password policy,
SSL encryption which is really important in my point of view,
secure and reputable web hosting company, as well as web application firewalls.
This section provides good information or has guided me to find
 some interesting information regarding website security.</p>
