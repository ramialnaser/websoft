<h2>S01</h2>
<p>
The answer regarding Git and GitHub is yes since we have used it
during the past two years in the university,
but it was good to review and read more about them,
plus there were some techniques about them that I wasn't aware of.
Markdown and GitHub pages, these two techniques are
completely new to me and so it's a great beginning to use or learn new tools.

Well, I have not done that before to create my own website or any,
but few years ago I have tried once but
at that time I had no knowledge regarding creating a new website,
so I stopped.

As my answer in the second question,
my experience and the knowledge I have regarding web development
are so little and it was when I tried to create my website from scratch,
at that time I tried to learn some tools and technologies
such as HTML and CSS and it was great stuff to learn
but it needed time to create the website that I needed so I stopped.

My "Today I Learned" for the section was almost everything
inside the section excluding some small thing and I was aware of,
but for example, the GitHub pages it was completely new to me,
and how to link files from on to another and from
inside a directory to another one

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>The knowledge that I have about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is so little,
   and so I have a little experience in HTML and CSS but nothing regarding JavaScript.
 Every Website we open in our browser uses HTML,
 it used to describe the structure of information on a web page.
  While CSS plays the role of the page's appearance and
   JavaScripts does the functionality or let's say that it programming its functionality. '
   The browser in other word a client sends and the server plays an important
    role to establish the connection over HTTP protocol, to establish the connection.
     The client(Browser) sends requests for services for example,
      and this request is known as an HTTP request, it goes to the server and the server
       searches for the data, if it finds it,
        it sends a response to the client, and the response called HTTP respond.
      I have learned how to create my own website and write in it and change pictures and sizes. </p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>No, I had no knowledge regarding client-side JavaScript. I can't compare it to Java since
it's the only programming language that I know, and I can't see the difference yet except that
the structure of the code is different. For now I did the requarments for grade 3, and since everything is new to me,
it was hard to finish, and have it fixed.</p>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>This is my first time working with node/npm and I had no experience in another
or equal programming tool, however it was a great tool to learn and do some small
exercises on them. Regarding the assignment, I had to do the steps or trainging before starting
the actual task because I don't think I would get it work without doing that, for now I finished
level three.</p>
