Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, 
Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?

The answer regarding Git and GitHub is yes since we have used it 
during the past two years in the university, 
but it was good to review and read more about them, 
plus there were some techniques about them that I wasn't aware of. 
Markdown and GitHub pages, these two techniques are 
completely new to me and so it's a great beginning to use or learn new tools.

Have you ever created websites before?

Well, I have not done that before to create my own website or any,
but few years ago I have tried once but 
at that time I had no knowledge regarding creating a new website,
so I stopped.

Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.

As my answer in the second question, 
my experience and the knowledge I have regarding web development 
are so little and it was when I tried to create my website from scratch,
at that time I tried to learn some tools and technologies 
such as HTML and CSS and it was great stuff to learn 
but it needed time to create the website that I needed so I stopped.

What is your TIL for this course section?

My "Today I Learned" for the section was almost everything
inside the section excluding some small thing and I was aware of,
but for example, the GitHub pages it was completely new to me,
and how to link files from on to another and from 
inside a directory to another one
